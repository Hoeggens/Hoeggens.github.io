## ABOUT ##

About Me

 Hi, I'm Pontus! I'm a web developer passionate about building
 
beautiful, accessible, and performant web experiences. My journey
started with curiosity for how things work on the internet, and has
grown into a love for open source, sharing knowledge, and
collaborating with others.


On this site, you'll find my projects, blog posts, and thoughts on
web development, TypeScript, and the ever-evolving world of frontend
technologies. I believe in continuous learning and enjoy helping
others grow in their coding journey.

When I'm not coding, you might find me exploring new tech,
contributing to open source, or enjoying a good cup of coffee.
Thanks for stopping by!
